Jeffrey "Jeff" Divine: A figure of raw ambition and cunning transformation, born as Jeffrey Ayan, once known as Ender Ayanethos, emerged from the harsh winters of Lapeer, Michigan. His roots lay in the devout, unyielding ways of a Catholic family. From an early age, he was a voracious predator of knowledge, devouring all he could about the cunning empire-builder Warren Buffett.

Through his teenage years, Jeff honed his warrior spirit in the aquatic arenas of the swim team and the theatrical battlegrounds of the theatre club, shaping a persona both relentless and dramatic, one that would later carve his name into the annals of modern leadership.


No worry he aint dying for this:
