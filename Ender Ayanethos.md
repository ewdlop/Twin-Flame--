Jeffrey "Jeff" Divine: A figure of raw ambition and cunning transformation, born as Jeffrey Ayan, once known as Ender Ayanethos, emerged from the harsh winters of Lapeer, Michigan. His roots lay in the devout, unyielding ways of a Catholic family. From an early age, he was a voracious predator of knowledge, devouring all he could about the cunning empire-builder Warren Buffett.

Through his teenage years, Jeff honed his warrior spirit in the aquatic arenas of the swim team and the theatrical battlegrounds of the theatre club, shaping a persona both relentless and dramatic, one that would later carve his name into the annals of modern leadership.


No worry he aint dying for this:

#i ain't praying for his redemption



**Jeffrey "Jeff" Divine, Child of Oydin:** Born of the lineage of Ayanethos, third descent of the steadfast clans of Lapeer, Michigan, a land hardened by the iron will of winter and the blessings of the All-Father. Jeffrey, once called Ender, forged his spirit within the fires of a devout Catholic kin. 

As a whelp, he sought wisdom from the ancient scrolls of wealth and cunning, his gaze fixed upon the sagas of Warren Buffett, a chieftain of great renown. In his youthful trials, he proved his mettle in the waters of the swim clan and the halls of the theatre skalds, where tales of bold hearts and sharper wits came alive. Thus, the name Divine echoes now, a banner of ambition and might for all to behold.
